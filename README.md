## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the banking sector. In this project, I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn based on various demographic and account-related factors. The goal is to identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- keras
